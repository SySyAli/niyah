# NIYA

**Put your money where your focus is. Earn it back, and more, by staying focused.**

## Problem

You want to stop doomscrolling. Screen time apps don't work because there's no real consequence. Willpower alone isn't enough.

## Solution

Trap your own money. Rescue it through discipline. Hit streaks and earn even more.

1. You deposit money or get bonus credit
2. Distracting apps get blocked
3. Complete focus sessions and get $1 back per day
4. Break early and that dollar stays locked
5. Perfect streaks unlock bonus multipliers so you can earn more than you started with

## How We Prevent Cheating

We don't spy on your usage. We track when you give up.

All distracting apps are blocked by default. Want to scroll? Tap "Take a break" and we log it. Finish a session without quitting and you earn. Random check-ins make sure you're actually there.

## Ways to Start

| Option | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| Deposit Match | Put in $30, we add $10. Earn back $40 or more. |
| Locked Card | Get a prepaid Visa that unlocks as you focus. |
| Try First | Free for 7 days. See what you'd earn. Then deposit to collect. |
| Defend Credit | Start with $30 credit. Lose $1 each day you fail. |

## How We Make Money

Users who don't finish streaks lose some of their deposit. That funds bonuses for users who do. We also offer tiered plans at $30, $60, and $100, plus an enterprise version for companies.

## Why This Works
